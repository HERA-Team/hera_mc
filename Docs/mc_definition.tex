\section{Introduction}
HERA is an international experiment to detect and characterize the Epoch of
Reionization (EOR).  The telescope is located at the South African SKA site in
the Karoo Astronomy Reserve.  This note summarizes Monitor and Control (\mc) subsystem for HERA.

Monitor and Control has two main tasks: configuration management and real time metadata logging. Configuration management involves tracking all the physical parts of the telescope and how they are all connected. Real time metadata logging tracks the performance, settings and communications of the subsystems.

The \mc\ system is built around a database with a well documented table schema and a python software layer to provide a simple developer framework. It also includes various online daemons for monitoring things, and both a front end web-based user interface and a command-line interface to support analysis code.

Software is contained in the repository https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera\_mc.

The organization of this document is as follows: the high-level \mc\ requirements and the design specifications are in laid out in section \ref{sec:reqs}, the configuration management is described in section \ref{sec:config}, the database tables are detailed in section \ref{sec:tables} and future plans are sketched out in section \ref{sec:future}.

\section{Requirements and Specifications}
\label{sec:reqs}

\subsection{Requirements}
These were developed and established in early 2016 in discussions among the subsystem leads.

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 Ability to fully reconstruct the historical state of the system.
	\1 All interactions between subsystems must go through or be logged by \mc.
		\2 Both subsystems in an interaction are responsible for logging communications to \mc.
		\2 Subsystems in an interaction are responsible for logging communications to \mc.
	\1 Operational metadata (e.g. temperatures, correlator bit occupancies) must be logged to \mc.
	\1 High availability (\mc\ must not limit uptime of telescope).
	\1 \mc\ is a provider of information about observations to end-users and must be available to them
\end{outline}

\subsection{Design Specification}
These were developed and established in 2016 based on the requirements.

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 SQL database
		\2 DB Design principle: every logical sub group has a group of tables.  One adds tables to do more things. E.g. different versions of subsystems add new tables. Operations reference which tables they use.
		\2 This document (and appendices) will contain all table definitions.
		\2 Use careful dB design to avoid duplicated data, make table links/data relationships clear, use many-to-one and many-to-many links.
		\2 Transactions must be used to ensure DB integrity.
		\2 Must be mirrored in some fashion to observer locations.
	\1 At least one SW interface layer will be provided.
		\2 It's not required to interact with \mc.
		\2 Must support relational db (i.e. multiple column primary and foreign keys) and transactions.
	\1 Hardware
		\2 LOM capabilities
		\2 Multi-teraByte mirrored disk RAID
		\2 Backup machine available on site
\end{outline}



% --------------------------- Configuration Management ------------------------------------------------------

\section{Configuration Management}
\label{sec:config}

The HERA array/part configuration management database is a set of five tables within the larger hera\_mc database, which is maintained on-site in the Karoo.  The tables are detailed in the Appendix,
but they are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
         {\bf psql table} & {\bf in python file}  &  {\bf with class name} \\
	geo\_location 	& hera\_mc/geo\_location.py & GeoLocation \\
	station\_type 	& hera\_mc/geo\_location.py & StationType \\
	parts 	& hera\_mc/cm\_part\_connect.py & Parts \\
	part\_info 	         & hera\_mc/cm\_part\_connect.py & PartInfo \\
	connections 	& hera\_mc/cm\_part\_connect.py & Connections \\
	cm\_version      & hera\_mc/cm\_transfer.py & CMVersion\\
	apriori\_antenna & hera\_mc/cm\_part\_connect.py & AprioriAntenna\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The databases are structured primarily around {\em parts} and {\em connections}.  {\em Parts} are meant to be single items that, in theory at least, are a thing that can be replaced as a unit.
{\em Connections} define {\em ports} on a given part and connect two ports together.  By convention, HERA part numbers ({\tt hpn}) are all upper case and ports are all lower case.

All parts and connections are timed in that they have a start and stop time of operation.  If stop is {\tt None}, then it is active (it is given a date in the relatively far future).  There are currently two special parts (one at each end of the signal chain) that are ``geo\_located'' parts and have entries in the geo\_location table: {\bf station} and {\bf node}.

Parts are hooked together via connections of their ports, as defined in the connection table.   There are two types of connections:  (1) ``hookup'' connections and (2) ``physica'' connections, discussed below.

To capture antenna status, an {\em a priori} antenna status table has been defined to facilitate a work flow to incorporate new antennas into the array and capture and known recalcitrant antennas.  The table provides an enumerated status for each antenna station.


\subsection{Operation Workflow}
The work flow in this context relates to antenna migration between one of the {\em a priori} status states above.  It is handled by the operations team, which will review the situation on a roughly monthly cadence.
The enumerated states are:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{-.3em}
            \item {\bf dish\_maintenance}: dish is either not completed or being repaired
            \item {\bf dish\_ok}: dish is ready for use
            \item {\bf RF\_maintenance}:  receiver system is either not installed or being repaired
            \item {\bf RF\_ok}:  receiver system ready for use
            \item {\bf digital\_maintenance}:  digital system is either not installed or being repaired
            \item {\bf digital\_ok}: digital system is ready for use
            \item {\bf calibration\_maintenance}:  calibration has not been conducted or current
            \item {\bf calibration\_ok}:  ready to use in analysis
            \item {\bf calibration\_triage}:  an issue is being worked on
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Signal Chain Hookup Connections}
Hookup connections are those that uniquely map the signal chain from the antenna to the node, including the specific correlator input.  These connections are defined in the file {\tt cm\_part\_connect} as the {\tt full\_connection\_path}.  These are the connections used to generate the correlator hookup.
The signal chain hook-up is given below and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hookup}, shown in black.  The list below describes the hookup connections.
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{-.3em}
	\item {\bf Station}: geo\_located position.  See prefixes in table station\_type ({\em e.g.} {\tt HH} for herahex)
	\item {\bf Antenna}:  This is also the correlator number which now matches station number.  {\tt{\bf A}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf Feed}:  element feed (Vivaldi).  {\tt {\bf FDV}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf FEM}:  front-end module. {\tt {\bf FEM}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf Node bulkhead plate}:  bulkhead plate on node.  {\tt {\bf NBP}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf PAM}:  post-amp module in node. {\tt {\bf PAM}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf SNAP}:  digitizer/channelizer in node. {\tt {\bf SNP}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf Node}: field-deployed node as a part {\tt {\bf N}\{\#\}}
	\item {\bf Node}:  geo\_located position for node as a station {\tt {\bf ND}\{\#\}}
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{hookup.pdf}
\centering
\caption{Block diagram of hookup.  The line labels indicate the port names/connections.}
\label{fig:hookup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Physical Connections}
Possibly not the most aptly named "physical" connections are other connections that we wish to track for various operational reasons (e.g. tracing a problem to a single PAM chassis etc).  Unlike for hookup connections, these are not defined anywhere and new ones may be included as needs arise.  They are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hookup} in blue.

\section{Future Plans}
\label{sec:future}
\subsection{Correlator Table plans}
\label{sec:corr_future}
The correlator tables are not all defined yet, the following are notes about suggestions and plans for correlator tables. Most of the correlator data will be recorded in a Redis database (a rolling log, ephemeral), that info needs to be grabbed and put in \mc tables.

\textbf{corr\_server\_status}: Correlator version of the server\_status table, see \ref{sec:server_status}, not yet implemented.

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 correlator on/off?	**this is a control**
	\1 Bit statistics (overflows, ADC clipping, bit statistics after bit selects)
	\1 correlator network stats (dropped packets)
	\1 Firmware git hash
	\1 Fengine status
	\1 Xengine status (might be covered in corr\_server\_status)
	\1 Walsh on/off	**this is a control** (correlator propagates to node)
	\1 Noise diode	**this is a control** (correlator propagates to node)
	\1 correlator config (walsh patterns; scaling functions for FFT, bit selection)
	\1 Test mode outputs (results not control) -- very notional
		\2 Fengine sync test
		\2 Xengine test
		\2 Do at beginning and end of night.
		\2 Analog tests
			\3 Noise diode status
			\3 Temperature (i2c device)
			\3 Walsh switching (on/off control. Make sure bit pattern is known and put into data set.)
	\1 SNAP information: all info reported through the correlator
		\2 Feed status
		\2 PAM status

	\1 Node information (from Arduino) (Dave, Jack, Zara, Matt Dexter (mdexter@berkeley.edu), Nima) All node info will be reported through the correlator.
		\2 Clock status info -- syncing
		\2 Temperatures (outside + inside, feed?)
		\2 Node \mc software git hash
\end{outline}

\subsubsection{Correlator interfaces complete:}
These are done:
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 \mc information the correlator needs to get and write into files
		\2 Antenna positions
	\1 New info added to correlator files (recorded in hera\_obs table)
		\2 obsid
		\2 duration
	\1 Node information (from Arduino) (Dave, Jack, Zara, Matt Dexter (mdexter@berkeley.edu), Nima) All node info will be reported through the correlator.
		\2 SNAP power states
		\2 Temperatures in nodes
		\2 Power PAM, FEM status (binary)
\end{outline}

\subsection{QA Future Plans}
\label{sec:qa_future}

These are some suggestions for the future, things we might like to see.

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 RTP/online systems
		\2 RFI statistics/info (this might be in ant\_metrics and array\_metrics now)
		\2 Calibration statistics (this might be in ant\_metrics and array\_metrics now)
		\2 LST repeatability
		\2 TBD other things that come up
	\1 Offline codes (Major work on how to implement this!! Not on the critical path):
		\2 TBD from offline analysis codes
\end{outline}

\subsection{Site Info Future Plans}
\label{sec:site_future}
The following are suggestions for the future, things we might like to see.
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 site power
	\1 network status
\end{outline}


\subsection{Other Future Ideas}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
	\1 Basic ionospheric monitoring
	\1 RFI monitoring
\end{outline}
