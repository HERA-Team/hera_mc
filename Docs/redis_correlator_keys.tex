\section{Introduction}
The HERA correlator implements a correlation pipeline using the HASHPIPE engine. The HASHPIPE library has built-in support for status monitoring using a redis database.
This document outlines the status keys the correlator posts to redis, most of which come from the original PAPER GPU correlator design.

\section{X-Engine keys}

X-engines store status hashes in redis using the keys: \texttt{hashpipe://<host>/<M>/status}, where `host` is the X-engine hostname (px\{1..16\}) and M is the pipeline instance (0..1) running on the machine.

Each status key may be queried using REDIS's \texttt{HGET} or \texttt{HGETALL} commands. Hash entries are as described in the following table. All entries are stored as strings.

\section{Catcher Keys}

The correlator catcher(s) store status hashes in redis using the keys: \texttt{hashpipe://<host>/<M>/status}, where `host` is the catcher hostname (hera-sn\{1..2\}) and M is the pipeline instance (currently always 0) running on the machine.

Each status key may be queried using REDIS's \texttt{HGET} or \texttt{HGETALL} commands. Hash entries are as described in the following table. All entries are stored as strings.
