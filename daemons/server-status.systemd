# Configuration file for systemd that keeps the M&C server status daemon running
#
# Copy this file to /etc/systemd/system/hera-server-status.service and
# edit the "UNDEF" below to correspond to the subsystem that this
# machine is part of: either "lib" or "rtp". You may also need to
# remove the "envs/HERA/" from the path if this machine doesn't use
# Anaconda environments. Then run `systemctl enable hera-server-status`
# and `systemctl start hera-server-status`.
