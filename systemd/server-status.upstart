# "upstart" configuration file that keeps the M&C server status daemon running
#
# Copy this file to /etc/init/hera-server-status.conf and edit the "UNDEF" below
# to the subsystem for this machine: either "lib" or "rtp". You may also need
# to remove the "envs/HERA/" from the path if this machine doesn't use Anaconda
# environments.
#
# For netboot machines that share an image but belong to different subsystems,
# change the UNDEF to something like `$(cat /persistent/etc/hera-subsystem.txt)`.
